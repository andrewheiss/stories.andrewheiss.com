<span class="newthought">Data rarely speaks for itself.</span> Without clear communication and a convincing argument, the theoretically rigorous and groundbreaking results you have found after months of backbreaking toil can easily be ignored. If you want people to understand and use your data and findings, you must present them in an engaging way.

In this class youâ€™ll learn how to use techniques long used by storytellers, documentarians, and artists to communicate your scientific findings in a way that is effective, engaging, professional, enjoyable, and memorable.

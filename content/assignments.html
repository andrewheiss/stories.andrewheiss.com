<div id="weekly-reflection-memo" class="section level2">
<h2>Weekly reflection memo</h2>
<p>You’ll need to submit a one-page (500 words) reflection by <strong>noon on Monday</strong> each week. You can do a lot of different things with this memo: discuss something you learned from the readings, write about the best or worst presentation you saw that week, connect the readings or projects from that week to your own work, etc. These memos essentially let you explore and answer some of the key questions of this course, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do people like stories?</li>
<li>What makes a good story? What makes a bad story?</li>
<li>What is the role of stories in presenting analysis?</li>
<li>What problems are there with framing scientific analysis as a story?</li>
<li>Why do we give presentations about research?</li>
<li>What makes a presentation worth attending?</li>
<li>What are good visual aesthetics?</li>
<li>What makes a good visualization? What makes a bad visualization?</li>
<li>How comfortable should we be with uncertainty?</li>
<li>How can you lie with statistics? How do you tell the truth with statistics?</li>
<li>How do you make sure people don’t think you’re lying with statistics?</li>
</ul>
<p>These memos are also to help me see what you glean from each week’s reading so I can prepare class discussions to be most useful and interesting to you. These memos will only be graded for completion. Instructions for submitting the memo will be in the assignment page for that week.</p>

<div id="projects" class="section level2">
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>In order to give you practice with the design and narrative principles you’ll learn in this class, you will complete three different projects, each focused on a different overarching course theme. In general, in these projects I will give you slides, charts, handouts, or academic papers that you will need to redesign or restructure. You will not need to create your own content for these assignments, and you’ll be able to use whatever program you feel comfortable with (Microsoft Office, Adobe applications, R, Tableau, etc.).</p>
<p>Specific details will be posted on the page for each individual project.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project-story-portfolio" class="section level2">
<h2>Final project: Story portfolio</h2>
<p>Each research presentation has a structure that has to change depending on the medium and audience of the presentation. For your final project, you will create a collection of stories for an academic research article I will provide you. Specifically, you will create the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An outline for a 60-minute talk</li>
<li>An outline for a 10-minute presentation (which you will then present)</li>
<li>A two-page policy brief</li>
<li>An op-ed</li>
<li>A 400-word blog post</li>
<li>A three-tweet tweetstorm</li>
<li>A single tweet<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A true 140-character tweet, not one of the new abonimable 280-character missives.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div id="story-maps" class="section level3">
<h3>Story maps</h3>
<p>Midway through the semester, you will map out the structure of your article and then create outlines for each of the parts of the story portfolio. You will receive peer feedback and feedback from me about the narrative structures you create.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-presentation" class="section level3">
<h3>Final presentation</h3>
<p>At the end of the course, you will turn in all the parts of your story portfolio and give a 10-minute presentation of your research article. I will grade these final presentations according to both your rubric and my own rubric, with equal weight (i.e. your rubric score consists of 50% of the total grade). These presentations will be held during the course’s scheduled final.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="story-rubric" class="section level2">
<h2>Story rubric</h2>
<p>Evaluating presentations is hard. The slides have to be well designed, the content needs to be good, the narrative has to be coherent, and the delivery must be excellent. How do you know if a presentation does all that?!</p>
<p>Over the course of the semester, you will develop your own rubrics for evaluating the (1) design, (2) narrative, and (3) delivery of a presentation, based on the readings, assignments, and classroom activities you’ll do. These rubrics can take any form you want, as long as they include some approach for scoring performance and some method for quickly identifying specific areas of improvement. Where possible, try to cite the materials you draw from to create the rubric items.</p>
<div id="draft-rubric" class="section level3">
<h3>Draft rubric</h3>
<p>Draft rubrics will be due at the end of each of the major course sections. You’ll get feedback about these drafts from your peers and me, but they will only be graded for completion. I will grade your final combined rubric according to a rubric I will provide you.</p>
</div>
<div id="rubric-test-run" class="section level3">
<h3>Rubric test run</h3>
<p>Before you turn in your final rubric, you’ll need to make sure it actually works. Use your improved draft rubrics to evaluate any research presentation (a live one in another class, a TED talk, an extra on-campus seminar, etc.). You’ll only be graded for completion.</p>

# Reflection memo

Write a 500-word memo about the assigned readings ([class 1](/reading/01-reading/); [class 2](/reading/02-reading/)) for this week. You can use some of the prompt questions there if you want. As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:

- How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?
- How does what I just read apply to me?
- How can this be useful to me?

Submit the memo as "Reflection 1" on Learning Suite by noon on Monday.

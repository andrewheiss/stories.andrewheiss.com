<h2 id="task-2-reflection-memo">Task 2: Reflection memo</h2>
<p>Write a 500-word memo about the assigned readings (<a href="/reading/09-reading/">class 9</a>) for this week. You can (should) use some of the prompt questions there if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you find the right balance of pathos, ethos, and logos in a presentation?</li>
<li>How does contrast create change and motivate audiences?</li>
<li>What is Hans Rosling’s Big Idea? How does Hans Rosling use contrast when presenting that idea?</li>
<li>How does Alan Alda’s experience with improv comedy and science communication relate to <em>Resonate</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?</li>
<li>How does what I just read apply to me?</li>
<li>How can this be useful to me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit the audience analysis <strong>and</strong> the memo as “Reflection 5” on Learning Suite by noon on Monday.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Stories are how</span> we translate core, essential <em>content</em> to different <em>forms</em> for specific <em>audiences.</em> Throughout this course, you have become an expert in doing this. Now you get to show off your shiny new skills.</p>
<p>For your final project, you will create a collection of stories for an academic research article that you’ve already selected. Here’s what you need to do and make. <strong><em>Pay attention</em></strong>—there are a lot of moving parts.</p>

If you actually post your thread, I want to see it—reply one more time and tag me (<a href="https://twitter.com/andrewheiss">@andrewheiss</a>) in the fourth tweet.<br />

<div id="complete-portfolio" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete portfolio</h2>
<p>Once you’ve created all these different story forms, compile them into a single PDF (using InDesign will likely be the easiest way to do this). <strong>Please look at <a href="/assignment/final-portfolio-example.pdf">this example of a final portfolio</a> to see how you might structure your project.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="final-deliverables" class="section level2">
<h2>Final deliverables</h2>
<p>In the end, I need the following outputs from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single PDF of your complete portfolio, uploaded to Learning Suite by 3:00 PM on Thursday, December 21.</li>
<li>A 10-minute in-person presentation, completed between 3:00–6:00 PM on Thursday, December 21. You should plan on attending the whole exam period to watch everyone else’s presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No late work will be accepted for this project since it counts as your final exam.</strong></p>
<p>Each element of the portfolio will be graded on how well you tell a story that is appropriate to its given audience, and (where applicable), how well you apply the principles of CRAP and data visualization. I will use <strong>this rubric</strong> to grade the final project.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Rubric forthcoming.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>

<br />
</span></span> I am happy to give feedback and help along the way—just not at, like, 2 PM on the day it’s due. Please don’t hesitate to come and get help!</p>
<p>And that’s it. You’re done! Go out into the world now and tell powerful, persuasive, and truthful stories.</p>

<h2 id="get-to-know-your-article">Get to know your article</h2>
<p>Read through your assigned article at least once.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-memo">Reflection memo</h2>
<p>Write a 500-word memo about the assigned readings (<a href="/reading/07-reading/">class 7</a>; <a href="/reading/08-reading/">class 8</a>) for this week. You can (should) use some of the prompt questions there if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does structure contribute to a story’s resonance and power?</li>
<li>What is the role of drama in communicating science and research?</li>
<li>What deeper social messages are communicated through stories like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>War and Peace</em>?</li>
<li>How can you know who your audience is? What if it’s not a specific group of people that will be in a room? How do you tailor your stories to huge audiences (like in a blog post, op ed, or tweet?)</li>
<li>How does viewing yourself as a mentor change your presentation style?</li>
<li>How can you encourage audiences (i.e. the hero) to change?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?</li>
<li>How does what I just read apply to me?</li>
<li>How can this be useful to me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit the memo as “Reflection 4” on Learning Suite by noon on Monday.</p>

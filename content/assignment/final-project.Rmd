<span class="newthought">Stories are how</span> we translate core, essential *content* to different *forms* for specific *audiences.* Throughout this course, you have become an expert in doing this. Now you get to show off your shiny new skills.

For your final project, you will create a collection of stories for an academic research article that you've already selected. Here's what you need to do and make. ***Pay attention***—there are a lot of moving parts.


# Big Idea

    - Who is your audience, what are its segments, and what are the benefits and risks for each of those segments?
    - How do you establish *what is*? How do you envision *what could be*? What kind of narrative contrast do you use to get there?
    - What evidence and facts will you present, and when? 
    - How is the structure of the talk connected to your audience segmentation analysis?
    - How does the presentation guide your audience on a journey to change and accept your big idea?

2. Using Word, **write** a brief outline for the talk.
3. Using PowerPoint, **create** a well-designed presentation to tell your story to your audience

1. **Identify** the (1) main audience, (2) audience segments, and (3) the benefits and risks for each of the segments for a 2-page policy brief
2. Using Word, **write** the text for the brief
3. Using Excel or R, create **at least two figures** (bar charts, scatterplots, maps, etc.) based on the data in the research article.
4. Using Illustrator, **enhance** the figures by highlighting trends, adding annotations, helpful captions, etc. Ensure that you follow the best practices you learned from Nussbaumber Knaflic's *Storytelling with Data* (review chapter 8).
5. Place the Word file and the PDFs you enhanced with Illustrator into InDesign and **create** a well-designed brief (similar to what you did in [Project 1](/assignment/01-project/)).

    - Who is your audience, what are its segments, and what are the benefits and risks for each of those segments?

Follow [\@JohnHolbein1](https://twitter.com/JohnHolbein1) for good examples of how to potentially do this.

    - Who is your audience, what are its segments, and what are the benefits and risks for each of those segments?

4. If you have a Twitter account, **post** the thread. To create a thread, reply to the previous tweet.^[That is, post the first tweet, reply to it, post the second tweet in the reply, reply to *that*, and post the third tweet in the reply to the second. If you actually post your thread, I want to see it—reply one more time and tag me ([\@andrewheiss](https://twitter.com/andrewheiss)) in the fourth tweet.]


# A single tweet

1. **Identify** the (1) main audience, (2) audience segments, and (3) the benefits and risks for each of the segments for a single tweet.

    - How do you establish *what is*? How do you envision *what could be*? What kind of narrative contrast do you use to get there?
    - What evidence and facts do you present, and when? 
    - How is the structure of the tweet connected to your audience segmentation analysis?
    - How does the tweet guide your audience on a journey to change and accept your big idea?

# Complete portfolio

Once you've created all these different story forms, compile them into a single PDF (using InDesign will likely be the easiest way to do this). **Please look at [this example of a final portfolio](/assignment/final-portfolio-example.pdf) to see how you might structure your project.**


# Final deliverables

In the end, I need the following outputs from you:

- A single PDF of your complete portfolio, uploaded to Learning Suite by 3:00 PM on Thursday, December 21.
- A 10-minute in-person presentation, completed between 3:00–6:00 PM on Thursday, December 21. You should plan on attending the whole exam period to watch everyone else's presentations.

**No late work will be accepted for this project since it counts as your final exam.**

Each element of the portfolio will be graded on how well you tell a story that is appropriate to its given audience, and (where applicable), how well you apply the principles of CRAP and data visualization. I will use **this rubric** to grade the final project.^[Rubric forthcoming.]

^[{-} ![Clapping](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4HodBpDmoMA5p9bG/giphy.gif)] I am happy to give feedback and help along the way—just not at, like, 2 PM on the day it's due. Please don't hesitate to come and get help!

And that's it. You're done! Go out into the world now and tell powerful, persuasive, and truthful stories.

# Reflection memo

Write a 500-word memo about the assigned readings ([class 10](/reading/10-reading/); [class 11](/reading/11-reading/)) for this week. You can (should) use some of the prompt questions there if you want:

-	How do organizational structures enhance (or detract from) the resonance of a presentation?
- Duarte's final rule for the section is that "Structure is greater than the sum of its parts." How so?
- How does Alda treat presentation structure in his book?
- Is it ethical to emphasize certain aspects of the facts in data more than others? How do you decide which facts to use to convince audiences?
- When you're telling a story about data, you're inherently manipulating audience emotions. Is that okay?
- In Nussbaumer Knaflic's complete example, the "after" version of the graphic is much more readable and impactful than the "before" version (see p. 205). The "after" version tells a complete storyâ€”but did it drop any other aspects of the data in the service of that story? Is that okay?
- What's the difference between tailoring data for specific audiences and "dumbing it down"?
- How does anti-intellectualism relate to science and data communication?

As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:

- How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?
- How does what I just read apply to me?
- How can this be useful to me?

Submit the memo as "Reflection 6" on Learning Suite by noon on Monday.

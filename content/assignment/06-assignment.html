<h2>Reflection memo</h2>
<p>Write a 500-word memo about the assigned readings (<a href="/reading/10-reading/">class 10</a>; <a href="/reading/11-reading/">class 11</a>) for this week. You can (should) use some of the prompt questions there if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do organizational structures enhance (or detract from) the resonance of a presentation?</li>
<li>Duarte’s final rule for the section is that “Structure is greater than the sum of its parts.” How so?</li>
<li>How does Alda treat presentation structure in his book?</li>
<li>Is it ethical to emphasize certain aspects of the facts in data more than others? How do you decide which facts to use to convince audiences?</li>
<li>When you’re telling a story about data, you’re inherently manipulating audience emotions. Is that okay?</li>
<li>In Nussbaumer Knaflic’s complete example, the “after” version of the graphic is much more readable and impactful than the “before” version (see p. 205). The “after” version tells a complete story—but did it drop any other aspects of the data in the service of that story? Is that okay?</li>
<li>What’s the difference between tailoring data for specific audiences and “dumbing it down”?</li>
<li>How does anti-intellectualism relate to science and data communication?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?</li>
<li>How does what I just read apply to me?</li>
<li>How can this be useful to me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit the memo as “Reflection 6” on Learning Suite by noon on Monday.</p>

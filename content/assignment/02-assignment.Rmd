# Reflection memo

Write a 500-word memo about the assigned readings ([class 3](/reading/03-reading/); [class 4](/reading/04-reading/)) for this week. You can (should) use some of the prompt questions there if you want. As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:

- How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?
- How does what I just read apply to me?
- How can this be useful to me?

Submit the memo as "Reflection 2" on Learning Suite by noon on Monday.

<h2 id="task-1-reflection-memo">Task 1: Reflection memo</h2>
<p>Write a <strong>400</strong>-word memo about the assigned readings (<a href="/reading/12-reading/">class 12</a>; <a href="/reading/13-reading/">class 13</a>) for this week. You can (should) use some of the prompt questions there if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do contrast and structure relate to STAR moments?</li>
<li>How does Alda discuss making memorable content? How is his view different from Duarte’s?</li>
<li>Why is PowerPoint so ubiquitous? Why is it dangerous? How should you use it responsibly?</li>
<li>What should you do when someone asks for your slides? What if it’s standard practice to share slides (like with investors)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?</li>
<li>How does what I just read apply to me?</li>
<li>How can this be useful to me?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-2-summative-assessment">Task 2: Summative assessment</h2>
<p><em>This memo is different</em>. Read the one reading for <a href="/reading/14-reading/">class 14</a> and write ≈<strong>400</strong> words exploring a few of these summative questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is truth?</li>
<li>How do we find truth?</li>
<li>Are facts truth?</li>
<li>How are stories related to truth?</li>
<li>What’s the difference between content and form?</li>
<li>Does beauty matter when describing truth or telling stories?</li>
<li>How does any of this philosophical humanities stuff relate to science and data communication?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit both tasks as “Reflection 7” on Learning Suite by noon on Wednesday.</p>

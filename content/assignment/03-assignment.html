<h2 id="reflection-memo">Reflection memo</h2>
<p>Write a 500-word memo about the assigned readings (<a href="/reading/05-reading/">class 5</a>; <a href="/reading/06-reading/">class 6</a>) for this week. You can (should) use some of the prompt questions there if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are affordances, accessibility, and aesthetics related to CRAP and the Gestalt principles of visual perception?</li>
<li>What are the common elements of good design in each of Nussbaumer Knaflic’s examples in chapter 6?</li>
<li>Why are stories so powerful?</li>
<li>Which of Nussbaumer Knaflic’s tactics to ensure your story is clear is most helpful to you?</li>
<li>According to Duarte, what’s the difference between presentations, facts, people, and stories?</li>
<li>What does Duarte mean when she says the audience should be the hero?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?</li>
<li>How does what I just read apply to me?</li>
<li>How can this be useful to me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit the memo as “Reflection 3” on Learning Suite by noon on Monday.</p>

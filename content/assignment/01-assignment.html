<h2>Reflection memo</h2>
<p>Write a 500-word memo about the assigned readings (<a href="/reading/01-reading/">class 1</a>; <a href="/reading/02-reading/">class 2</a>) for this week. You can use some of the prompt questions there if you want. As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?</li>
<li>How does what I just read apply to me?</li>
<li>How can this be useful to me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit the memo as “Reflection 1” on Learning Suite by noon on Monday.</p>

# Mini project: Dickensian social safety net and mental health facilities

Using Ancestry.com's 1861 workhouse inmate data, create a one-page handout that would accompany a hypothetical presentation about mental health facilities in Victorian England. You can see full details of the dataset (as well as the code to generate the figures) at [the page for Class 5](/class/05-class/#long-term-workhouse-inmates-in-england-and-wales-1861).

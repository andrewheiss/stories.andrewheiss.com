# Long-Term Workhouse Inmates in England and Wales, 1861

^[{-} ![Workhouse](/images/class/workhouse.jpg) [Poor people coming to a workhouse for food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Poor_people_coming_to_a_workhouse_for_food,_c._1840_Wellcome_L0006802.jpg)] 

> *"Are there no prisons?" asked Scrooge.*
>
> *"Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.*
>
> *"And the Union workhouses?" demanded Scrooge. "Are they still in operation?"*
>
> *"They are. Still," returned the gentleman, "I wish I could say they were not."*
> 
> *"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?" said Scrooge.*
>
> *"Both very busy, sir."*
>
> *"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course," said Scrooge. "I'm very glad to hear it."*

In 1834, the [Poor Law Amendment Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Law_Amendment_Act_1834) grouped local church parishes into unions and charged them with the responsibility of caring for the poor through workhouses. The Act was [highly controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_the_English_Poor_Laws#Opposition_to_the_1834_Poor_Law_Amendment_Act) and arguably led to underemployment and starvation. 

Charles Dickens was especially not a fan, and he dedicated a whole novel to critiquing them (*Oliver Twist*), and he had Scrooge praise them in *A Christmas Carol*.

[Ancestry.com has an incredible 115-page book](https://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=61439) that lists all 14,216 people that had been been inmates for at least 5 years in all workhouses in England and Wales as of 1861. Eighteen years after Scrooge's 1843 Christmas conversion, workhouses were still incredibly well-used and housed all those who were "unable to maintain themselves."

Nowadays, [we have better terms for the types of mental illness](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/778288) noted by the 19th century workhouse statisticians:

- *Idiocy, imbecility*: intellecutal disabilities, such as fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, William syndrome, Rett syndrome, autism, etc.
- *Insanity, lunacy, weak mindedness*: mental illnesses, such as dementia, schizophrenia, melancholia, anxiety, depression, manic-depressive illness, bipolar disorder, etc.

**Text for annotations**: 

- Winners from Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest
- It's that time of year again. Since 1916, the annual eating competition has grown substantially attracting competitors from around the world
- Frank Dellarosa eats 21 and a half HDBs over 12 minutes, breaking the previous record of 19 and a half
- Through 2001-2005, Takeru Kobayashi wins by no less than 12 HDBs. In 2006 he only wins by 1.75. After winning 6 years in a row and setting the world record 4 times, Kobayashi places second in 2007.
- For the first time since 1999, an American reclaims the title when Joey Chestnut consumes 66 HDBs, a new world record. Chestnut repeats in 2008.

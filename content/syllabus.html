</span></span> Without clear communication and a convincing argument, the theoretically rigorous and groundbreaking results you have found after months of backbreaking toil can easily be ignored. If you want people to understand and use your data and findings, you must present them in an engaging way.</p>
<p>In this class you’ll learn how to use techniques long used by storytellers, documentarians, and artists to communicate scientific findings in a way that is effective, engaging, professional, enjoyable, and memorable.</p>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level2">

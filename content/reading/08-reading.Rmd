# Required

- Chapters 3 and 4 in Nancy Duarte, *Resonate* [@Duarte:2010]
- Read your assigned article at least once


# Questions to reflect on

-	How can you know who your audience is? What if it's not a specific group of people that will be in a room? How do you tailor your stories to huge audiences (like in a blog post, op ed, or tweet?)
- How does viewing yourself as a mentor change your presentation style?
- How can you encourage audiences (i.e. the hero) to change?
